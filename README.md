Data Analysis and Clustering on "Prices of Personal Computers" Dataset

**Dataset Overview**: 
Analyzed a dataset containing 6259 observations of personal computers sold in the United States from 1993 to 1995. The dataset includes 10 features such as price, clock speed, hard drive size, RAM, screen size, CD-ROM presence, multimedia kit inclusion, manufacturer premium status, the number of price listings per month, and a time trend variable.

**Techniques Applied**:
**K-means Clustering**: Implemented K-means clustering to identify patterns and groupings within the data based on features such as price, speed, and RAM. Identfiied the optimal value of cluster using the elbow method based on the total within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) plot. 
**Hierarchical Clustering**: Conducted hierarchical clustering to determine relationships and hierarchies between different personal computers.
